Clone the Repository (First Time)
Students run this in the VS Code terminal:

   ```
cd <repository-folder>
2️⃣ Create a Personal Branch
Each student creates a branch with their name:

git checkout -b student-name
3️⃣ Solve the Homework
Students edit the JavaScript file(s) to add their solutions.

4️⃣ Commit & Push Their Work
git add .
git commit -m "Added solution by student-name"
git push origin student-name
That’s it! Their branch is now in GitHub, but they don’t have to open GitHub at all.
