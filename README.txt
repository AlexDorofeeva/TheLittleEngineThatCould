🔄steps for Team members:

Clone the Repository (First Time)
1️⃣Team members run this in the VS Code terminal:

                cd js homework team

Each Team member creates a branch with their name:

                git checkout -b Team member-name

🔹example: git checkout -b Alex
🙏🙏🙏send me name you choose for your branch‼️

3️⃣ Solve the Homework
Team members edit the JavaScript file(s) to add their solutions.

4️⃣ Commit & Push Their Work

                git add .

                git commit -m "Added solution by Team member-name"
🔹example: git commit -m "Added solution by Alex"

                git push origin Team member-name
🔹example: git push origin Alex
